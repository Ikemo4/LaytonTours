<!--This page will display the available times. Ignore the time slots on the
SignUpGenius page. For our purposes, we will say the tours occur every hour on the
hour from 8:00 am – 8:00 pm (i.e. the last tour starts at 8:00 pm.) Once the user selects a
time, they are routed to a form that has the date info set, but allows the user to enter their
info.-->
